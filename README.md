# PyBer_Analysis
## Ride Share Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of the new analysis is to review data of ride sharing in order to determine the differences between the different city types and their ride sharing stats. We are wanting to look at the fare for the ride sharing and also the amount of rides and drivers in each city type. This analysis will show us where ride sharing is more common and how cost effective it is for each city type.

### Results
We have created a summary for the ride sharing data for PyBer.

This summary shows us that urban cities use ride sharing more often than other types of cities. There is a significant increase in the amount of total drivers and total rides in urban cities from the amount for rural and suburban cities. We can also see that the average cost of ride sharing in rural cities is the highest.

We can also see above that urban cities had the highest fare out of the city types but all city types took a drop in May.

### Summary
Based on the summary analysis for ride sharing, my recommendations to PyBer are as follows:
We need to increase the amount of drivers in suburban and especially rural cities to keep up with the demand of riders. The cost of ride shares in rural cities is significantly higher than that in urban cities which is either a result from the lack of drivers or the distance the riders are traveling using ride shares. If we can increase the amount of drivers in suburban and rural areas, we can expect to increase the revenue as we will be able to provide more rides to consumers since drivers will typically have to travel farther distances due to location. I would also recommend that we offer some type of incentive such as discounts for consumers that are using our ride sharing regularly. By offering these types of incentives, we could possibly increase revenue as well because our consumers will be more likely to continue to use our ride sharing to earn these incentives. In addition to offering incentives to consumers, we could also offer incentives to the drivers when they complete so many drives or miles. This could help us bring in more drivers to meet the demand of rides.
